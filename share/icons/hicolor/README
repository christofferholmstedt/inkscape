This directory contains the themable icons. 16x16 and 24x24 versions are
automatically generated from the scalable originals. There are two
helper scripts provided:

* update-makefiles.sh - update the Makefile.am's in all subdirectories
	so that all icons placed in them are installed.
* render-icons.sh - for each subdirectory of the form <number>x<umber>
	in this one, render the icons from the scalable directory
	<number>x<number> pixels large into the appropriate directories,
	so that the content and directory structure matches the scalable tree.

If you add / delete / rename an icon in the scalable tree,
run render-icons.sh and then update-makefiles.sh; at the moment render-icons.sh
requires the librsvg2-bin package. In the future it might use Inkscape,
provided that some bugs in the command line interface are fixed.

The index.theme file contains the description of icon directories that is used
on Windows. On non-Windows systems, this file already exists in another
directory (typically /usr/share/icons/hicolor), so it's not necessary.
