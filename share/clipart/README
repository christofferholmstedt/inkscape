This directory is for collecting user-supplied clipart for use with
SVG editors such as Inkscape.  

Where possible please organize clipart collections into
topic-oriented sub-directories.  For example, "street_signs",
"landscape_symbols", "flowchart_symbols", or "geometric_shapes".

The the time of submission please send an email containing your email
address, a copyright statement with your real name and the current year,
and the license you permit reuse of the art under.  

We will only include clipart submissions under open source or public
domain licenses.  We prefer Public Domain for simplicity, but will take
work under licenses such as Artistic, BSD or LGPL.  If you have
questions about the meaning of various licenses, please see
www.open-source.org and www.creativecommons.org.

If you choose to place your work In the Public Domain, you will need to
fill out a form at the CC site to make it legal:

    http://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain-2 

This will generate an RDF receipt that you should include with your
submission.  If you submit a package of clipart, you need only include
one copy of the public domain receipt for the whole package.
