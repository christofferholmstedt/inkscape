This folder contains Inkscape extensions, i.e. the scripts
that Inkscape uses to perform some specialized functions.

Each *.inx file contains a description of an extension,
listing its name, description, prerequisites, etc. These
files are read by Inkscape on launch. Other files are
the scripts themselves (Perl, Python, and Ruby are 
supported, as well as shell scripts).

Some of the scripts here are not (yet) hooked up to Inkscape
in any way but can be used from the command line (e.g. 
inkscape-shadow*).
