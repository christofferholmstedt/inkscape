CHANGING ICON THEMES
--------------------
The Inkscape icons are read from the file 'icons.svg' that resides in the same
directory as this README.

If you want to try a new theme, create a folder named 'icons' in your personal
Inkscape folder (under Linux/Unix: $HOME/.inkscape), copy the file containing
the alternative theme in that folder and rename it to icons.svg. The next time
Inkscape is run the alternative icons will be loaded.


CREATING A NEW ICON THEME
-------------------------
To create a new theme or simply modify some icons you need to make sure each
icon is assigned the correct ID (its name). Opening 'icons.svg' in Inkscape and
selecting an icon will display its ID in the XML editor (Shift+Ctrl+X).

The simplest way to proceed is to work on a copy of the icons.svg file and
modify each icon one after the other, using the XML editor to adapt its ID.

For example, if you've drawn a new pen icon, select it on the canvas, then open
the XML editor. The node corresponding to the pen icon will be highlighted.
Click on its ID in the upper right panel of the XML editor. The bottom right
panel will display something like 'g2570'. Change that value to 'draw_pen' and
click the 'Set' button.
