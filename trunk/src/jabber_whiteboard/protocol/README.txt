To do a LaTeX compilation of the Inkboard protocol specification, do the following:

1) Run svg2eps.sh to convert the SVGs to EPS files, or do some equivalent procedure.
2) Run the command

	latex protocol

The fancyvrb, enumerate, and graphicx packages are required.


IMPORTANT NOTE: This protocol specification is nowhere near finalized.
