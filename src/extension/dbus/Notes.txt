BUGS:
    *Inkscape crashes if widow is closed while code is running,
        need better error handling.
    
    *Pause updates needs work.
    
    *The following methods are broken:
        -document_interface_selection_move_to_layer
    
    *The following are not implemented:
        -document_interface_layer_get_all
        -document_interface_selection_box
        -document_interface_get_node_coordinates
        
    *The following do not behave like the documentation:
        -document_interface_transform
        -document_interface_text

EFFICIENCY:
    *Need better way to retrive objects by name.
        Switch to GQuark codes for object retrival?
    
    *Rethink how often activate_desktop needs to be called.
    
    

FEATURES:
    *Find out more about extension API.
    *API compatibility for plugins?

CLEANUP:
