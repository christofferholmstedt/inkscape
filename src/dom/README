Phoebe DOM
==========

This is the DOM library that is going to provide
Inkscape with a w3c DOM-idl interface,  hopefully
aiding in scripting and animation.

The name 'Phoebe' in inherited from an older project
which had its own DOM implementation.  The name itself
is of a moon of Saturn.

The library is intended to be 'vanilla' and generic.  The
library has its own parser, even if it is not used.
The base code should never be modified to be Inkscape-specific.
It should not have any dependencies beyond STL, nor 
should it veer away from adherence to the W3C DOM APIs.

The most common usage of this library would probably be
limited to the classes defined in dom.h.  A scriptable
item would inherit and extend org::w3c::dom::Node, and modify
the behaviour of the getters and setters for its attributes.
