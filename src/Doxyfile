# Uncomment this to treat undocumented things as if they had an empty

# Leaving it uncommented allows using doxygen output as the primary information
# source about a class (without needing to look at the source code to look for
# undocumented things).
# OTOH, you may find it annoying to have reems of relatively unhelpful
# information: commenting it out gives more compact display of the helpful
# bits.
# I'm commenting it out for now to facilitate checking existing doc comments
# for doxygen correctness.

# It's unclear whether programmers should deliberately use this facility.

# Disadvantage: Absence of `\brief' may indicate that the comment was written
# by someone unfamiliar with doxygen and not giving thought to what the brief

# OTOH, using `\brief' may be parrot-like: it doesn't necessarily indicate
# doxygen familiarity.
