1. libspchelp

Here you find:

Useful add-ons to gnome-canvas, such as:
  gnome_canvas_item_i2p_affine

Canvas items useful for editing:
Ctrl - a small rectangle, which do no scale when parent is scaled
CtrlRect - 'rubberband' box
CtrlLine - simple straight line
Probably some of these will be rendered without libart at all - we do not
need antialias for rubberband.

Yet to implement:
Guide - simple guideline.
FastSVP, FastVpath - not decided yet, but for node editing it seems to be
useful to have special rendering mode - fast stroking of single pixel wide
lines without antialias.

2. libgt1

This is complete placeholder. All type1 parsing code is already included
in gnome-print development version and as soon as it will be more widely
available, I remove this.

These programs are written mainly by Adobe and Raph Levien, probably others.
I modified gt1-parset1.c to force it to display most of iso-8859-1 characters.
