All code files in this directory are *direct* copies of the files in 2geom's svn.
If you want to change the code, please change it in 2geom, then copy the files here.
Otherwise, I will probably miss that you changed something in Inkscape's copy, and
destroy your changes by copying 2geom's files over it during the next time I update
Inkscape's copy of 2geom.
