inkscape (0.38.1+0.39pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * This is upstream version 0.39pre3. The versioning of debian is to make
    sure the final version 0.39 is greater than this pre-Versions
  * removed "Conflicts: inkscape-cvs" and "Provides: inkscape" from debian/control
    because the regular inkscape package should be installable parallel to
    inkscape-cvs (if I ever have time to create this one)
  * added "Suggests: sketch" to debian/control because inkscape can use sketch
    to export eps.
