Remarks about fonts

1. System-wide font sources

Sodipodi tries to extract font information
from different sources. Depending on your library
versions, this may, or may not succeed:

xft - It usually works, but for some fontconfig setups
compiling this in may fail. In which case there is no
fonts available.

libgnomeprint - only libgnomeprint 2.0 works currently.

windows font database - this, of course, is used only
under win32

2. User-defined fonts

If freeType2 support is compiled in (it usually is),
you can add fonts by hand to sodipodi. This can also be
useful to define aliases etc.

Create file $HOME/.sodipodi/private-fonts

Add one line for each font

filename[:face number],font name,family name

Face number if TrueType collection face number, it can
be omitted safely.
Font and family names should be space-delimited 'true'
names of font.
Example:

garbdi.ttf,Garamond Bold Italic,Garamond
