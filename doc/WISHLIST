Inkscape Wishlist
-----------------
This file is for capturing random details about desired development
work, ideas, etc.  The Inkscape feature request page is probably a
better location for such things, but this can serve as a convenient
scratchpad. 


Rework xml tree
===============
use reprs as lightweight wrappers around gnome-xml,
keeping syntax as close to DOM as possible


Split SPDesktop object into modular inherited objects
=====================================================
SPDesktop - base, has drawing group, no contexts
SPEDesktop - editable desktop - more full-featured
SPNamedDesktop - Desktop, deriving its layout from NamedView - i.e. guides,
  grid etc. will be saved per-desktop

desktop_show_borders/hide_borders - show/hide rulers & stuff - usable for
  Bonobo component



Javascript for Animation support(?)
===================================

The main reason JavaScript would be tricky is that it would be modifying
the document out from under you via the DOM, so you couldn't have a
"time slider" or something like you could for the SMIL stuff.

That's a real headache, and the only way I can see it working is if the
document is cloned and played back in a separate "audition" window, then
the modified document thrown away at the end.

But then, why implement Javascript in Inkscape?  An audition feature
that calls out to an external player application would work just as well
(and indeed, that's exactly how applications like Flash cope with
scripting).

[ note that implementing scripting for Inkscape itself is a separate
issue, and probably warrants a language-agnostic scripting interface
like the GIMP's PDB, only less grotty ]
